# Code snippets for Bristol IEU / ALSPAC / Bluecrystal 4 use

I'm using this git to share any code I think may help anyone working in Bristol Uni with ALSPAC. 

In particular, basic Bluecrystal 4 processes which took me forever to learn because I couldn't find up-to-date examples. 

[GWAS using SNPTEST and bash wrapper](GWAS_Bluecrystal4_SNPTEST.sh)
[Heritability analysis using GCTA](Heritability_Bluecrystal4_gcta)
[LD Score regression](LDscore_regression_Bluecrystal4_ldsc) - unfinished
